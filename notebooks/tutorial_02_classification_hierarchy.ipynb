    "\n",
    "*To the research assistant:*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your analysis of Vold's Passage Diagrams has proven illuminating. The Committee now asks you to examine her secondary claim—that the Archive's classification system itself has categorical structure.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Archive organizes documents, creatures, and places into hierarchies: scholarly works contain mathematical treatises; creatures contain predators; predators contain apex predators. Vold noticed that these containment relationships have a peculiar property: between any two categories, there is at most ONE way to go from one to the other.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is unlike the passage diagrams, where multiple morphisms might connect the same pair of objects (different creatures taking different paths). In a classification hierarchy, either A is contained in B, or it isn't. There's no \"multiple ways\" to be contained.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Vold wrote: \"The Archive itself is a category. Every classification is a morphism. To place a document is to draw an arrow. But unlike the passages of creatures, these arrows are unique—or absent.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your task: Verify Vold's claim by examining the Archive's classification records. Determine whether hierarchical classification forms a category, and if so, what special properties it possesses.*\n",

    "1. Load and explore the Archive's classification data\n",
    "2. Understand **pre-orders** as special categories\n",

    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 1, we saw that categories can have multiple morphisms between the same pair of objects. A stakdur might take several different paths from its territory to the reed marsh, and each path is a distinct morphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some categories are more restrictive. A **pre-order category** has a special property:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Between any two objects A and B, there is **at most one** morphism from A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In notation: |Hom(A, B)| ≤ 1 for all objects A, B.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can replace morphisms with a simple relation: either there EXISTS a morphism A → B (written A ≤ B), or there doesn't.\n",

    "1. **Reflexive**: A ≤ A for all A (identity morphisms exist)\n",
    "2. **Transitive**: If A ≤ B and B ≤ C, then A ≤ C (composition exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are exactly the category axioms! A pre-order IS a category where morphisms are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "A **partial order** adds one more property:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Antisymmetric**: If A ≤ B and B ≤ A, then A = B\n",
    "\n",
    "This means no two distinct objects can each contain the other. Most classification systems are partial orders, not just pre-orders.\n",
