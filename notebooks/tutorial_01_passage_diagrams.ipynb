    "\n",
    "*In Year 892, Vold proposed a radical hypothesis: that relationships are more fundamental than objects themselves. Where her contemporary Erris Pol asked \"What are the Forms?\", Vold asked a different question: \"How do things relate to each other?\"*\n",

    "*Vold believed that any entity could be fully characterized by how other entities pass through it, around it, or interact with it. A stakdur is not defined by its claws or its coloring—it is defined by what flees when it approaches, what territories it traverses, what prey it consumes.*\n",

    "**Tessery Vold** (Year 856–938) was an Archivist at the Western Archive who spent decades cataloging how things move, transform, and relate. She encountered a puzzle in Year 892: the same creature—the stakdur—was classified differently in Capital records, Western Archive logs, and Quarry naturalist reports. Yet all three classifications captured something true about the creature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital taxonomists explained this as error or regional variation. Vold found this explanation unsatisfying. The classifications weren't wrong—they were *perspectives*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vold began asking a different question: *What if an entity's identity isn't intrinsic, but emerges from its relationships?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Year 892, Vold proposed the **Relational Framework**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Consider the stakdur. You need not describe its claws, its coloring, its size. Simply tell me: what creatures flee when it approaches? What territories does it traverse? What prey does it consume? The stakdur is not a thing. The stakdur is a pattern of passages.\"*\n",
